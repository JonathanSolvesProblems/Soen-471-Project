# Soen-471-Project

TODO with group before February 5th: write 100-word abstract of our planned project.

Discussed so far:

Based on the context of what was written and on the days as well. Correlate that with the number of reactions.

Plot the long/latitude and classify the coordinates based on how close they are to each other. Then cross reference the coordinance
of actual raids that happen to check if the user's coordinates matches that to see if they were actually at that raid.
The month/day/hour is there as well, so can use that to check the time they were there.

Analyzing the length of the video to compare activity.
Maybe third party tool to find exact video from .json file that can tell us the title to give us context on what it's about.

Another idea. Figure out which products got marked up on amazon because of Covid.

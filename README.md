### Abstract

The aim of our project is to be able to predict the number of up-votes a user has on a post, based off the Parler messaging app. 
We consider the up votes to be a representative of the user's engagement with others. We aim to determine which factors, such as keywords, 
type of user, time of day, etc. contribute to how popular a post will get. To this end, we intend to utilize a linear regression model, 
as well as decision tree model to distinguish between the quality of their predictions and the internal data processing and manipulation by each model.
